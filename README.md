# Air Writing Recognition with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe

## Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning model that can recognize finger motion and interpret it as air writing on the screen. It leverages Python along with the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries to achieve real-time gesture recognition and drawing.

## Features

- **Real-time Finger Motion Recognition:** Uses MediaPipe to detect and track finger movements.
- **Air Writing:** Translates finger gestures into text or drawings on the screen.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Displays the recognized text or drawing in a window using OpenCV.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `mediapipe`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-writing-recognition.git
   cd air-writing-recognition
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python mediapipe
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   Execute the main script to start the air writing recognition:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Interacting with the Application:**

   - **Camera Access:** The application will access your webcam to track finger movements.
   - **Drawing:** Use your finger to draw in the air. The application will interpret your gestures and display the corresponding text or drawing on the screen.
   - **Exit:** Press `q` while the OpenCV window is in focus to exit the application.

## Code Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that initializes the camera, processes frames using MediaPipe, and handles drawing on the screen.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for gesture recognition and drawing.

## Example

Here's a quick example of how the finger motion is recognized and translated into text:

1. **Start Drawing:** Move your finger in the air in front of the camera.
2. **Text Recognition:** The system will recognize the shapes and translate them into text.
3. **Display:** The recognized text will be shown on the screen in real-time.

## Troubleshooting

- **Camera Issues:** Ensure that your webcam is properly connected and accessible by other applications.
- **Dependencies:** Verify that all required packages are correctly installed. If you encounter issues, try updating them or consult the package documentation.
